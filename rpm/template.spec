%description
The follower demo was implemented using a 360 Laser Distance Sensor LDS-01. The
classification algorithm is used based on previous fitting with samples of
person and obstacles positions to take actions. It follows someone in front of
the robot within a 50 centimeter range and 140 degrees.
